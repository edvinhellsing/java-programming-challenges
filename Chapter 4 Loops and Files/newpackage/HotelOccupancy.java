/* Write a program that calculates the occupancy rate for each floor of a hotel. The program should start by asking for the number of floors in the hotel. A loop should then iterate once for each floor. During each iteration, the loop should ask the user for the number of rooms on the floor and the number of them that are occupied. After all the iterations, the program should display the number of rooms the hotel has, the number of them that are occupied, the number that are vacant, and the occupancy rate for the hotel.

Input Validation: Do not accept a value less than 1 for the number of floors. Do not accept a number less than 10 for the number of rooms on a floor.

A hotelâ€™s occupancy rate is calculated as follows:
Occupancy rate = 5 Number of rooms occupied / Total number of rooms */
