# Java Programming Challenges
The repository presents my suggested solutions to Java related programming challenges given and the end of every chapter in the textbook, without solutions which I more than once during the process would have found useful. The book in question is "Starting Out with Java: From Control Structures through Objects (6th Edition)" by Tony Gaddis (2015).

# Objective
The aim of this repository is to document my progress learning Java by reading the book and attempting to solve the problems given at the end of every chapter through out the book. The solutions presented can, besides from me getting a general understanding of programing concepts in Java, hopefully help other people with their process of learning Java.
